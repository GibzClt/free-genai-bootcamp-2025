## Examples
- ### Conversation
  - **Student Input**:
    An apple a day keeps a doctor away
  - **AI Assistant Output**:
    That's a famous proverb! Let's break it down into smaller parts and translate it into Japanese step by step.
    First, how would you say "an apple" in Japanese? Think about the word for "apple" in Japanese...(Hint: It starts with "R")
  - **Student Input**:
    I think it is Ringo ?
  - **AI Assistant Output**:
    The Japanese word for "apple" is indeed (Ringo). Well done!
    Now, let's think about the phrase "a day". How would you express the idea of "one day" or "per day" in Japanese?
    (Hint: It involves a counter for days, which is (nichi))
  - **Student Input**:
    I am not sure of that.
  - **AI Assistant Output**:
    It's a bit tricky.
    In Japanese, when you want to say "per day" or "a day", you can use the phrase (ichi nichi). Here, (ichi) means "one" and (nichi) means "day".
    So, if you want to say "an apple a day", you could start with:
    (Ringo) ... (ichi nichi)
    Can you think of how to continue the sentence to express the idea of "keeps a doctor away"?
  - **Student Input**:
    I know that doctor means isha
  - **AI Assistant Output**:
    In Japanese, (isha) indeed means "doctor".
    Now, let's think about the phrase "keeps away". How would you express the idea of something being "kept away" or "prevented" in Japanese?
    (Hint: There's a verb that's commonly used to express this idea, and it starts with the letter "y")
  - **Student Input**:
    Sorry, I don't know
  - **AI Assistant Output**:
    It's a bit challenging.
    The verb I was thinking of is (yokusu), but there's a more common way to express "keeps away" or "prevents" in Japanese.
    Let's use the verb (sakeru) instead. However, in this context, we need to use the more polite form of the verb, which is (sakeru) → (sakern).
    Now, let's put it all together:
    (Ringo) (ichi nichi) (isha o sakern)
    Does that look correct to you?
  - **Student Input**:
    yes
  - **AI Assistant Output**:
    You've successfully translated the proverb "An apple a day keeps a doctor away" into Japanese:
    (Ringo) (ichi nichi) (isha o sakern)
    Great job! You should be proud of yourself.
    By the way, the correct pronunciation for this sentence is:
    "Ringo ichi nichi, isha o sakern"
    Keep practicing, and you'll become more confident in your Japanese skills!

- ### Conversation
  - **Student Input**: Actions speak louder than words.
  - **AI Assistant Output**: That's a great proverb! Let's try to translate it into Japanese.
To start, can you break down the sentence into its key components? For example, what's the subject, and what's the main action or verb?
Also, do you know any Japanese phrases or vocabulary that might be related to this proverb?
  - **Student Input**: I think for "actions" it is Akushon
  - **AI Assistant Output**: That's a good guess, but not quite accurate. In Japanese, "actions" is more commonly translated as (kōdō).
    (akushon) actually refers to "action" in the sense of a movie or theatrical performance.
    Now, let's think about the verb. What's the main action or verb in the sentence "Actions speak louder than words"? Can you think of a Japanese verb that might fit this context?
  - **Student Input**: speak
  - **AI Assistant Output**: For the verb "speak", a common Japanese translation is  (hanasu).
    Now, let's put it together. We have  (kōdō) for "actions" and  (hanasu) for "speak". How do you think we can connect these words to convey the idea that "actions speak louder than words"?
  - **Student Input**: kodo hanasu urusal
  - **AI Assistant Output**: I see you're trying to put the sentence together!
    Let's break it down:
    - (kōdō) is correct for "actions".
    - (hanasu) is correct for "speak".
    However,  (urasal) isn't quite right. Can you think of a Japanese word that means "louder" or "more strongly"?
    Also, we're missing a crucial part: "than words". How do you think we can express "words" in Japanese?
  - **Student Input**: kotoba
  - **AI Assistant Output**: (kotoba) is a perfect translation for "words"!
    Now, let's revisit the sentence. We have:
    - (kōdō) for "actions"
    - (hanasu) for "speak"
    - (kotoba) for "words"
    To convey the idea "louder than words", we can use the phrase "" (kotoba yori mo), which means "more than words" or "louder than words".
    Can you try putting the sentence together again using these components?
  - **Student Input**: kodo hanasu kotobo yori mo
  - **AI Assistant Output**: You're very close!
    Just a small correction:
    (kotoba) should be (kotoba) with a slight change in the kanji character.
    So, the corrected sentence is:
    (kōdō wa hanasu kotoba yori mo)
    You were missing the topic marker (wa) after (kōdō), which indicates that "actions" is the topic of the sentence.
    Great job getting so close! You're almost a master of Japanese proverbs!
