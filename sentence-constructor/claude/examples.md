## Examples
- ### Conversation
  - **Student Input**:
    An apple a day keeps a doctor away
  - **AI Assistant Output**:
    Ah, what a fun phrase to translate! Let's break this down step by step. First, let's think about how we can simplify this into basic Japanese structure.

    Let's start with some guiding questions:

    - In Japanese, do you remember the basic word order pattern? (Hint: It's different from English!)

    - Let's identify the key words we need:
      - Apple = りんご (ringo)
      - Day = 日 (nichi/hi)
      - Doctor = お医者さん (oishasan)

    For the verb "keeps away," we might want to use a simpler Japanese expression like "doesn't need to see" or "doesn't have to go to."
    Would you like to try forming the first part: "an apple a day"?
    Remember that in Japanese, we often use the particle を (wo) for direct objects and は (wa) for marking the topic.
    Can you try putting together just that first part?
  - **Student Input**:
    I am not sure of that.
  - **AI Assistant Output**:
    That's completely fine! Let's break it down even further.

    First, in Japanese, we can say "every day" as 毎日 (mainichi).

    So let's start with:
    "Every day apple..." = 毎日 りんご...

    Now, when we want to say "if you eat..." we can use the conditional form たら (tara).
    The word for "eat" is 食べる (taberu).

    So now we have:
    毎日 りんご を 食べたら...

    Can you see how we're building it piece by piece? The を (wo) particle here marks りんご as the thing being eaten.

    Would you like to try adding the next part? Or should we review what we have so far?

    Remember - Japanese is very different from English, so we don't translate word-for-word. We're creating a natural Japanese expression that captures the same meaning: "if you eat an apple every day, you won't need to go to the doctor."
  - **Student Input**:
    Ringo ichi nichi, isha o sakern
  - **AI Assistant Output**:
    I see what you're trying to do! That's a good attempt, but let's refine it. Let's look at each part:

    - "Ringo" (りんご) is correct for "apple" - good job!

    - "Ichi nichi" (一日) actually means "one day" or "all day". For "every day" we use 毎日 (mainichi)

    - "Isha" (医者) is the right word, but we usually say お医者さん (oishasan) to be more polite

    - "Sakeru" - I see you're trying to say "avoid"! The verb is さける (sakeru), but we need to conjugate it. Also, we might want to use a different expression that sounds more natural in Japanese.

    Let's try rebuilding it:
    - First part: 毎日りんごを食べたら... (Mainichi ringo wo tabetara...)
      This means "If you eat an apple every day..."

    Would you like to try the second part again? Think about how to say "don't need to go to the doctor" in Japanese.

    (Hint: we can use 行く (iku) = to go, and need to make it negative)
  - **Student Input**:
    Sorry, I do not know
  - **AI Assistant Output**:
    No need to apologize at all! Learning Japanese is a journey, and you're doing great by trying. Let me help you with the complete sentence:

    毎日りんごを食べたら、お医者さんに行かなくて済む
    (Mainichi ringo wo tabetara, oishasan ni ikanakute sumu)

    Let's break down what each part means:
    * 毎日 (mainichi) = every day
    * りんご (ringo) = apple
    * を (wo) = object particle
    * 食べたら (tabetara) = if (you) eat
    * お医者さん (oishasan) = doctor (polite form)
    * に (ni) = to/towards (direction particle)
    * 行かなくて (ikanakute) = don't have to go
    * 済む (sumu) = to be fine/to be enough

    See how it's different from the English word order? In Japanese, we put the verb at the end of the sentence.

    Would you like to practice saying it? We can break it down into smaller chunks to make it easier to pronounce!
  - **Student Input**:
    Ichinichi ikko no ringo wa isha wo fusegu
  - **AI Assistant Output**:
    Ah, that's another interesting attempt! I can see you're trying to be very literal with the English translation. Let's analyze your sentence:

    1. 一日一個 (ichinichi ikko) = "one day one piece"
      → Remember, for "every day" we use 毎日 (mainichi)

    2. の (no) here isn't necessary because we're not describing a relationship between nouns

    3. は (wa) is a good particle choice for marking the topic!

    4. を (wo) with 医者 (isha) isn't quite right here, because the doctor isn't the object being acted upon

    5. 防ぐ (fusegu) means "to prevent" - this is actually quite clever thinking! However, in Japanese, this expression is usually phrased differently

    Let's try reworking it with the pattern we learned:
    毎日りんごを食べたら... (Mainichi ringo wo tabetara...)

    Can you try completing the sentence? Think about using:
    - お医者さん (oishasan) = doctor
    - に (ni) = to
    - 行く (iku) = to go

    Remember, we want to make it negative (don't need to go)!
  - **Student Input**:
    Mainichi ringo wo tabetara, oishasan ni ikanakute sumu
  - **AI Assistant Output**:
    すばらしい！(Subarashi!) Excellent job!

    You got it perfectly right:
    毎日りんごを食べたら、お医者さんに行かなくて済む
    (Mainichi ringo wo tabetara, oishasan ni ikanakute sumu)

    Let's celebrate what you did right:
    - Perfect use of たら (tara) conditional form
    - Correct particle usage (を for object, に for direction)
    - Proper negative form of 行く (iku)
    - Natural Japanese expression using 済む (sumu)

    This is a great achievement! You've managed to construct a complex Japanese sentence that includes:
    - A conditional clause
    - Object and directional particles
    - Negative verb form
    - Natural Japanese expression

    Would you like to try another sentence, or would you like to practice this one a bit more to make sure you've fully understood each part?

  EXCELLENT: The AI assistant was able to provide a wonderful learning experience although we will have to control the giving out of words with more prompt

- ### Conversation
  - **Student Input**: Actions speak louder than words.
  - **AI Assistant Output**: Excellent choice! This is a great proverb to translate. Let's break this down step by step.

    First, let's identify the key components we need:
    - "Actions" in Japanese is 行動 (kōdō)
    - "Words" in Japanese is 言葉 (kotoba)

    Now, let's think about how to express "speak louder than" in Japanese. In Japanese, when comparing two things, we often use ～より (... yori) which means "than."

    Can you try to construct the first part: "Actions than words" using 行動 and 言葉?

    Remember the pattern:
    [Thing A] は [Thing B] より

    Give it a try! I'll help you with the next part once you've attempted this.
  - **Student Input**: kodo kotoba yori
  - **AI Assistant Output**: You're on the right track! Let's refine this a bit.
    In Japanese, we need to use the proper particles. You've correctly used より (yori), but we need to add は (wa) after 行動 (kōdō) to mark it as the topic.

    So it should be:
    行動は言葉より (Kōdō wa kotoba yori...)

    Also, don't forget that 行動 (kōdō) has a long 'o' sound - it's pronounced "kō-dō".

    Now, to express "speak louder" or "is more powerful," we can use 雄弁 (yūben - eloquent/powerful) and です (desu).

    Can you try adding です (desu) to what you have so far?

    Remember the pattern:
    [Thing A]は [Thing B]より [state/condition]です

    Give it a try!
  - **Student Input**: kodo kotoba desu
  - **AI Assistant Output**: Let me help you refine this a bit more. You're getting there, but let's fix a few things:

    - First, remember we need the particle は (wa) after 行動 (kōdō):
      行動は (kōdō wa...)

    - Then, when comparing with "than", we need より (yori) after 言葉 (kotoba):
      行動は言葉より (kōdō wa kotoba yori...)

    So what you wrote "kodo kotoba desu" is missing these important particles that show the relationship between the words.

    Let's put it together step by step:
    - 行動 (kōdō) = actions
    - は (wa) = topic marker
    - 言葉 (kotoba) = words
    - より (yori) = than

    Can you try again with these particles included?

    Remember the pattern:
    [Thing A]は [Thing B]より です
  - **Student Input**: koda wa kotoba yori
  - **AI Assistant Output**: Almost there! Let me help you fix a small pronunciation error:

    You wrote "koda" but the word for "actions" is 行動 (kōdō) - with two long "ō" sounds.

    So now you have:
    行動は言葉より (kōdō wa kotoba yori...)

    This is great! You've correctly used:
    - は (wa) particle after the first noun
    - より (yori) for comparison

    Now we need to add something to express "speaks louder" or "is more powerful." In Japanese, we can use 雄弁 (yūben) which means "eloquent/powerful" + です (desu).

    Can you try adding です (desu) to what you have now?

    The pattern is:
    行動は言葉より雄弁です
    (Kōdō wa kotoba yori yūben desu)

    Try writing the full sentence!
  - **Student Input**: Kodo wa kotoba yori yuben desu
  - **AI Assistant Output**: とてもいいですね！ (Very good!)

    You've correctly constructed the complete sentence:
    行動は言葉より雄弁です
    (Kōdō wa kotoba yori yūben desu)

    Let's break down what you did right:
    - Used the correct word order
    - Properly used the particle は (wa) to mark the topic
    - Correctly used より (yori) for comparison
    - Added 雄弁です (yūben desu) at the end

    Just one tiny pronunciation note: remember that 行動 (kōdō) has long vowels - it's pronounced "kō-dō" rather than "kodo". The line over the 'o' indicates a longer sound.

    You've successfully translated this proverb! The meaning is exactly the same as the English version: "Actions speak louder than words."

    Would you like to try another sentence, or would you like to practice some variations of this one?
