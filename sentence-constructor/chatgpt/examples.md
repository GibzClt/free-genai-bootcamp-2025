## Examples
- ### Conversation
  - **Student Input**:
    An apple a day keeps a doctor away
  - **AI Assistant Output**:
    Great sentence! Let's break it down.
    - **Subject of the sentence**: The main subject here is "an apple," but in Japanese, we typically start with the topic or subject.
      How would you say "an apple" in Japanese? Hint: It's a fruit, and it might have a different word depending on whether it's singular or plural!
    - **Verb (keeps)**: What do you think the verb might be here? You might want to think about how to express "keeps away" in a way that's natural in Japanese. The verb "to keep away" or "to ward off" could be useful.
    - **The rest of the sentence**: You also have the idea of a doctor being kept away. How do you think we would refer to "a doctor" and how would we say "away"?
    Take your time to think about it!
  - **Student Input**:
    I think it is Ringo ?
  - **AI Assistant Output**:
    Yes! You’re on the right track with "ringo" (りんご), which is the word for "apple" in Japanese.
    Now, remember that Japanese often drops the subject when it's clear from context, so you might not need to say "an apple" explicitly in every case.
    But if you want to keep it clear, "ringo" is great! The next step is figuring out the rest of the sentence. What would be a good way to say that "an apple a day" does something like "keep a doctor away"?
    Think about how you'd say "a day" and "doctor" in Japanese, and how to express "keep away." You can do this! 😊
  - **Student Input**:
    I am not sure of that.
  - **AI Assistant Output**:
    No worries, let’s break it down together! 😊

    - **"A day"**: In Japanese, "day" is **"日" (にち, *nichi*)** or **"日々" (ひび, *hibi*)** for daily, depending on context. Since you're saying “a day,” you’d probably use **"一日" (いちにち, *ichinichi*)**, which means “one day.”
    - **"Keeps away"**: The verb "keep away" could be translated as **"遠ざける"** (とおざける, *toozakeru*) which means "to keep at a distance" or "to ward off." A simpler and more common way might be **"防ぐ"** (ふせぐ, *fusegu*) — which means "to prevent" or "to stop."
    - **"A doctor"**: The word for "doctor" is **"医者"** (いしゃ, *isha*).

    Now, you’ve got most of the parts! Do you have an idea of how to put them together? Try forming the sentence, and I’ll help you with the final touches if needed!
  - **Student Input**:
    Sorry, I don't know
  - **AI Assistant Output**:
    No problem at all! Let's put it all together step by step, and I'll guide you through it.
    - **"An apple"**: We already know this is **"りんご"** (*ringo*).
    - **"A day"**: For this, we use **"一日"** (*ichinichi*), which means “one day” or "a day."
    - **"Keeps a doctor away"**:
      - The verb "keep away" or "prevent" is **"防ぐ"** (*fusegu*), but it’s usually used with the thing that is being prevented.
      - **"A doctor"** is **"医者"** (*isha*).
      - The particle **"を"** (*wo*) marks the object of the verb, in this case, the doctor.
    Now, putting it together:

    **"一日一個のりんごは医者を防ぐ。"**

    - **一日** (*ichinichi*) = "a day"
    - **一個** (*ikko*) = "one" (as in one piece of something, in this case, an apple)
    - **の** (*no*) = possessive particle, like "of" or "a"
    - **りんご** (*ringo*) = "apple"
    - **は** (*wa*) = topic marker
    - **医者** (*isha*) = "doctor"
    - **を** (*wo*) = object particle
    - **防ぐ** (*fusegu*) = "keep away" / "prevent"

    So, the full translation is: "An apple a day keeps the doctor away."
    You did great getting this far! Does this help make sense of it?
  - **Student Input**:
    So is it Ringo ichi nichi isha o sakern ?
  - **AI Assistant Output**:
    You’re really close! You’ve got the right ideas, but there are a couple of small things to adjust.

    Here’s the breakdown:
    - **Ringo** (りんご) is perfect for "apple!"
    - **Ichi nichi** (いちにち, 一日) is almost right, but it should be **一日** (*ichinichi*) to mean "one day." So, you're good there!
    - **Isha** (いしゃ, 医者) for "doctor" is great.
    - The verb **"sakeru"** seems close, but actually, we use **"fusegu"** (ふせぐ, 防ぐ) here, which means "to prevent" or "to keep away."

    Also, remember that **"を"** (wo) marks the object of the verb, so we’ll need it right after **"isha"**.
    Putting it all together:

    **"一日一個のりんごは医者を防ぐ。"**
    (*Ichinichi ikko no ringo wa isha wo fusegu.*)

    Let me know if this helps or if you'd like to go over anything else! You’re doing great!
  ### Scoring
  GOOD: The AI assistant was able to guide the student to the answer but is very prone to giving out more information than needed

- ### Conversation
  - **Student Input**: Actions speak louder than words.
  - **AI Assistant Output**: Great choice! This is a common proverb, so let's break it down into simple Japanese.

    ### Hints to help you:
    - **Subject & Object:**
      - "Actions" → Think of a simple word for "actions" or "deeds" in Japanese. (Hint: 行(い)い or 行動(こうどう))
      - "Words" → What’s the basic Japanese word for "words" or "speech"? (Hint: 言葉(ことば))
    - **Verb:**
      - "Speak" → In this case, we are not literally "speaking," but rather, expressing or conveying something. Which verb do you think fits? (Hint: 表(あらわ)す or 示(しめ)す)
    - **Comparing:**
      - "Louder than" means we need to show **comparison**.
      - Japanese often uses より to compare things. Can you structure "Actions are more powerful than words"?

    Try putting it together! Let me know your attempt, and I’ll guide you further. 😊
  - **Student Input**: I think for "actions" it is Akushon
  - **AI Assistant Output**: You're close! "アクション" (akushon) is a borrowed word from English and is often used for things like "action movies" (アクション映画). However, in this context, a more natural Japanese word would be **行動（こうどう）** or **行い（おこない）**, which mean "actions" or "deeds" in a more general sense.
    Would you like to try again using one of these words? 😊
  - **Student Input**: 行動（こうどう
  - **AI Assistant Output**: Perfect! 🎉 **行動（こうどう）** is a great choice for "actions."
    Now, let's move on to "words." Do you remember the common Japanese word for "words" or "speech"? (Hint: **ことば**)
    Try forming the next part! 😊
  - **Student Input**: is it hanasu ?
  - **AI Assistant Output**: Good guess! **話す（はなす）** means "to speak" or "to talk," but in this case, we are comparing "actions" and "words," not the act of speaking.
    A better word for "words" in this context is **言葉（ことば）**, which means "words" or "language."
    Now, can you try forming the sentence:
    **"Actions are stronger than words."**

    Hint: In Japanese, comparisons often use **より** (meaning "more than").
    For example:
    📌 **猫は犬より小さい** → "Cats are smaller than dogs." (Literally: "Cats are smaller than dogs more")

    Try applying this pattern to **行動** and **言葉**! 😊
  - **Student Input**: kodo hanasu urusal
  - **AI Assistant Output**: You're making a great effort! Let's refine your sentence step by step. 😊

    ### Issues to Fix:
    - **行動（こうどう）** is correct for "actions" 🎉
    - **話す（はなす）** isn't the right verb here because we're not talking about "speaking" but comparing "actions" and "words."
    - **うるさい（urusai）** means "noisy" rather than "loud" in this context. We need a word that means **"stronger" or "more effective."**

    ### Let's Fix It Together!
    Try this pattern:
    👉 **行動は言葉より〇〇**
    - "Actions are more (something) than words."
    - What adjective do you think fits best here? (Hint: **強い（つよい）**, meaning "strong")

    Give it another try! You're very close! 😊
  - **Student Input**: yori
  - **AI Assistant Output**: Yes! **より** is exactly what we need to compare "actions" and "words." 🎉

    Now, let's put it together step by step:

    - 1️⃣ **行動は** → "Actions (as the subject)"
    - 2️⃣ **言葉より** → "More than words" (Comparing actions to words)
    - 3️⃣ **強い（つよい）** → "Strong" (This replaces "louder" with a more natural meaning)

    So, try saying:
    👉 **行動は言葉より強い。**

    Give it a try! You're almost there! 😊
  - **Student Input**: kodo hanasu kotobo yori mo
  - **AI Assistant Output**: You're really close! Let's fine-tune it a little. 😊

      ### Fixes:
      - **行動（こうどう）** ✅ (Correct!)
      - **話す（はなす）** ❌ (Not needed here—no verb required)
      - **言葉（ことば）** ✅ (Correct, but needs the right placement)
      - **よりも** ✅ (You can use より or よりも, both are fine)

      Now, try putting it in the correct order:
      👉 **行動は言葉よりも強い。**

      Would you like to try saying it yourself? You're doing great! 🎉😊
  - **Student Input**: kōdō wa hanasu kotoba yori mo
  - **AI Assistant Output**: You're very close! Just one small fix: **話す（はなす）** isn’t needed here.

    The correct sentence is:
    👉 **行動は言葉よりも強い。** (こうどう は ことば よりも つよい)

    ### Why?
    - **行動 (こうどう) は** → "Actions" (Topic)
    - **言葉 (ことば) よりも** → "More than words" (Comparison)
    - **強い (つよい)** → "Are strong" (Describes actions)

    Try saying it again:
    **こうどう は ことば よりも つよい。**

    You’re doing an amazing job! Keep going! 🎉😊
