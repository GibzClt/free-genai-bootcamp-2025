# Architecture Details

## Functional Requirements
The company wants to establish their own gen-ai infrastructure to protect confidential details related to the registered users' data and to have more control on the type of output produced

The company currently has an estimate of around 300 students as active users and a majority of them are located in Nagasaki, Japan

## Assumptions
We are assuming that the Open-source LLMs will be powerful enough to run on hardware with an investment of 10-15K.
We are going to host a single server from our centre and we are expecting it to have enough bandwidth to serve our user requests.

## Data Strategy
There is concern of accessing copyrighted materials from the internet. Therefore we need to purchase data and store them in our database for access.
